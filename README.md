# Debugging Javascript with VSCode

## Overview

VSCode has powerful debugging support that allows you to step through your code, line by line, when it runs.

More usefully, you can set a `breakpoint` on a specific line of code that will cause the debugger to run your code until that line is reached and then it will allow you to run it line by line from that point.

While you are running line by line, you have the ability to examine the values of variables to let you understand how your program is executing - usually in cases when it does not do what you expect!
